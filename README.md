1.MongooseError: Operation posts.insertMany() buffering timed out after 10000ms
2.Error for starting app.js due to not finding files like .ejs
3.Im bad at writing ejs so because of that there is bunch of problems cause program cant do it ant take information.
Because of that i needed make a repo and doing experiment and if something dont go well just clone this and continue.

Well i thinks all problem is inside index.ejs when i want every post have their 'date'  doint throug ejs and i didnt follow
behind the process when mongosql started giving errors too like 'cant connect' thing.
Im working on i
